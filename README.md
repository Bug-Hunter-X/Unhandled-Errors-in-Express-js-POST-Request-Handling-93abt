# Unhandled Errors in Express.js POST Request Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: improper handling of missing or invalid request bodies in POST requests, and insufficient error handling during database operations.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route that attempts to create a new user.  It fails to handle cases where the request body (`req.body`) is empty or contains invalid data.  Additionally, it lacks robust error handling for database interactions, potentially leading to application crashes or inconsistent responses.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.  It includes thorough validation of `req.body`, handling cases where it's missing or contains invalid data.  Furthermore, improved error handling ensures that any database errors are caught gracefully, preventing application crashes and providing informative error messages to the client.
